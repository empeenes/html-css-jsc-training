        <div align="center"><img srcset="./images/cs2.jpeg 1080w" alt="Counter-Strike-2" /></div>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;">About</h4>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
        Counter-Strike 2 is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter, in which two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists,
        compete to complete different objectives, depending on the game mode selected.
        Most game modes play out over several rounds; in-between rounds, players are able to purchase different weapons and equipment to use.
        In most game modes, players have a single life per-round; if a player dies during a round, they will be unable to play until the beginning of the next round.
        New gameplay mechanics in Counter-Strike 2 include volumetric "smoke physics",
        a feature where the smoke generated by a smoke grenade grows to fill spaces, and can be altered in real time by gunshots or through the use of hand grenades.
        Additionally, the game features a revised weapon loadout system, which only allows players to bring five pistols,
        five "mid-tier" weapons (i.e SMGs and shotguns), and five rifles with them into a match, for a total of fifteen weapons.<br />

        In 2014 was released spin-off titled <a href="https://www.gry-online.pl/gry/counter-strike-nexon-zombies/za3e0b">Counter Strike Nexon Zombies.</a> Reception from critics was generally negative,
        with criticism aimed at the game's poor user interface, microtransactions, and dated graphics.
        In my opinion this game was an answer for hyped post-apo zombie theme reffering to popular TV series The Walking Dead and sequel Fear The Walking Dead,
        which I obviously recommended.

        <div align="center"><img srcset="./images/Lol.jpeg 1080w" alt="League-of-legends" class="center"/></div>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;">About</h4>
        <p style="text-align:center;">
        Players are formed into two even teams primarily comprised of five members. Each team starts at opposing sides of a map, near what is called a "Nexus".
        To win a match, a team must destroy the opposing team's Nexus.
        To do so, each team must work through a series of towers called 'turrets' that are placed along three paths to each base (commonly referred to as 'lanes').
        Along the way, each player gains power by completing game objectives, earning them experience points and gold that are used to increase the player's level
        and to purchase powerful items, potentially giving players an advantage over their opponents.
        Examples of these objectives include killing the opposing team's turrets, players, and 'minions' (small NPCs that constantly spawn and attack the other team).<br /><br />
